# Lizardman_TechAdvancing_Patch_B18
An XML patch to provide compatibility between Tech Advancing and Lizardman mods for RimWorld B18. 
This is just a fix for making Tech Advancing by GHXX play nice with the Lizardman mod by Undereastern. Lizardman has some research that can only be researched if you're playing as a lizardman tribe, but if you're not, it just sits there and doesn't let you research it. This halts your ability to advance your tech level without tinkering around with the Tech Advancing rules quite a bit, which can be very tedious unless you know what you're doing. So, I made this mod for ease of use. Obviously requires both other mods, and place below them in your load order. It SHOULD make Tech Advancing ignore the Lizardman research as being something required to advance your tech level.

Make sure you place this after both Tech Advancing and Lizardman mods in your load order (and all the required mods they have.)
